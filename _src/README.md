Java EE Development with NetBeans 7 shows you how to develop applications using the most important and latest Java EE technologies and APIs such as JavaServer Faces (JSF) 2.0, Enterprise JavaBeans (EJB) 3.1, and the Java Persistence API (JPA 2.0). The course is a practical guide explaining the various features of the NetBeans IDE related to Enterprise application development.

Java EE Development with NetBeans 7 covers all the major Java EE technologies, APIs, and the rapid development capabilities of the NetBeans IDE such as wizards and keyboard shortcuts.
While focusing on NetBeans features, you will learn how to develop aesthetically pleasing web-based user interfaces using Java Server Faces. You’ll also learn how to take advantage of automated transaction handling and scalability via Enterprise JavaBeans, and how to simplify database access through the Java Persistence API.
